    <p>
      A healthy body is a must have for a happy life. “Health is wealth”, we all know that. In fact, we all want to remain happy and healthy. But there are certain issues specially with women health that are actually not much talked about in the society. 
    </p> 
    <p>
      When we look around ourselves, in almost every second household, women have some kind of ailment, which over a period of time turns into a chronic disease, for example PCOS.
    </p> 
    <p>
      REASON: lack of awareness to cure about such issues.
    </p>
    <p>
      Women have a different kind of hormonal structure in their body, unlike men and therefore they require special care attention for themselves. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Most women around us, till their 40s, tend to develop severe body pain (back/ legs/ joints etc.), HORMONAL ISSUES (PCOS/ thyroid/ diabetes/ Irregular periods etc.), excessive fat deposits in body, everlasting headaches, poor muscles, weaker bone density and related health issues, caused by their not-so-good lifestyle & diet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, our pharmaceutical medication is not 100% effective in resolving all these health issues permanently, without causing any side-effect to the body. And, that’s the reason why for many women, medication never ends. 
    </p>
    <p>
      However, it has been observed that many of these issues would never even arise if women have a better happy and healthy Lifestyle, if they eat right and exercise in the right order. In fact, most of the diseases that we face actually never need medicines but a better lifestyle (like PCOS and other hormonal issues).
    </p>
    <p>
      The situation becomes even worse when over a period of time such illnesses (like Hormonal issues) start affecting the mental & emotional health of women. This reduces down their efficiency and productivity.
    </p>    
    <p>
      Women play such an important role in our society. It has been observed that if women are happy and healthy, the entire household is easier to be happy, as most women play the key role in the households of our Indian society. 
    </p>    
    <p>
      Therefore, We, at HerCrew, are on a mission to make Women in our Indian society, HAPPIER and HEALTHIER by bringing positive changes in their Lifestyle and overall wellbeing.
